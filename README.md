# Abstract challenge
Welcome to the first TITCO abstract challenge! You should write your abstract in [R Markdown]
(https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) using the [abstract template provided here](abstract-template.Rmd).

## Weekly goals 

### Week 1 
Provide a rough draft of the complete abstract.

### Week 2
Write code for the results section.

### Week 3
Submit your abstract as a R markdown file in a pull request to this repository.

1. Create a GitHub account
2. Fork this repository
3. Upload your abstract to abstracts/ in your fork
4. Create a pull request

### Week 4
Revise according to the comments. Specifically:

1. Make sure you import the raw data. Do not manipulate the data outside of R, just import the original file.
2. Use inline `R`, avoid copying and pasting results into your abstract. See [@Aroke-Anna8 abstract](https://github.com/titco/abstract-challenge/blob/2f4f63c807a87b16a9fbe2f8f184548e22b539a1/abstracts/Aroke-Anna8-abstract.Rmd#L262).

### Week 5
Pull the changes to this repository using Rstudio. Then revise according to the changes, push to your fork and finally submit a pull request. Do not upload a new file using GitHub's upload file feature.

### Week 6
See Week 5. Some of you are getting close to finalising the abstract and start writing up the full paper. However, first you need to add a table of sample characteristics. Hint: have a look at the `tableone` package.
